# Welcome to Lightcaster!
Lightcaster is a work-in-progress game created by [Iskandar Zulkarnaien](https://github.com/iskandarzulkarnaien) (thats me!). It is my first game development project, and is built using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library. 

At its core, Lightcaster is a game about light and optics and aims to invoke in its players the same sense of wonder and curiosity I had about physics when I was growing up.

Lightcaster is heavily influenced by Daniel Shiffman's (AKA: 'The Coding Train' on YouTube) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo) on Raycasting, which I found to be totally cool and inspired me to create a game based on rays and reflections.

If you have any questions and suggestions, or spot any bugs, feel free to let me know [here](https://github.com/iskandarzulkarnaien/Lightcaster/issues).

So what are you waiting for? Give the game a shot [here](https://iskandarzulkarnaien.github.io/Lightcaster/)!
